        <h1>Paul Jhon Magbanua</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Paul and I am currently learning Website development. I started coding when back when I was 8th grader just because I am bored caused by the quarantine. Coding had made significant change to the way I think. Also it taught me to communicate in a technical level.</p>
